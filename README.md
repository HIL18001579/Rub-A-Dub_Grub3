# Rub-A-Dub_Grub3
Food app designed for an assignment that allows a user to order food and drinks from a breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks menu.
The app notifies users if they are not connected to the internet and allows a choice of tables to for seating and food delivery.
It creates an itemised bill when finished ordering and uses Firebase for the Recyclerview listItems - the final sending of the order 
to the course leaders database was not completed.

I hope it helps you out.
